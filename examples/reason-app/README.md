# Reason App

This example shows how to use [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/en/) with Poi.

## Notes

The entry file `src/index.re` is configured via [`source` field in `package.json`](./package.json#L3) so that we don't need another Poi config file just for customizing entry point.

## Usage

In this directory run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Script

### `yarn dev`

Start dev server to preview your app.

### `yarn build`

Build your app for production use.
